Asset Library
============

- `images/raw` – original uploads straight from camera or design tools.
- `images/processed` – cropped/optimized variants ready for use in the app.
- `icons` – monochrome or multicolor icon sets (SVG/PNG).
- `fonts` – custom typefaces and licensing info.
- `video` – teaser clips, background loops, or explainers.
- `docs` – attribution, model releases, or any other asset-related paperwork.

Drop new files into the most appropriate folder. Keep raw originals untouched so updates can be regenerated easily.
